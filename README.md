# shortlist-storytelling-template-js

This repository contains the application files for the "Shortlist" story map app.  

The app presents a curated set of points of interest.  You can organize your POIs by theme; for example, Food, Hotels, and Attractions. As users pan and zoom, the app presents POIs only for the current map extent.
